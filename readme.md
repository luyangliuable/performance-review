I received 24 pieces of feedback from my stakeholders through Workday. I was recognised 12 times through Everyday Recognition. I was most recognised for my unwavering commitment to do what is right and working with others to get things done.

Achievements and impact:

Led the development of the 'Agentic Framework' as a one-person team, creating a first-of-its-kind solution incorporating FastAPI, Langraph, LLM integration, and guardrail services. I independently delivered this scalable and modular solution within a few months, demonstrating strong technical capabilities in state management, RAG modules, and workflow creation. The framework's success was validated through a demonstration to the crew alongside Thomas Kong.
Successfully contributed to the 'XENA' project through multiple technical implementations including authentication systems using next-auth and drizzle ORM, developing a sophisticated chatbot with parquet file parsing capabilities, and establishing critical connectivity between XENA Backend and GenAI Swimlane in DHP infrastructure. My work was instrumental in achieving the team's first Fast Track release and successful production deployment.
Made significant contributions to infrastructure modernisation by supporting the Apache Airflow tech stack setup and assisting in migrating GitHub Enterprise Cloud (GHEC). This work improved the technology estate's efficiency and scalability while maintaining system reliability.
Defined and implemented comprehensive XENA agent workflow and services, including creating the Metadata Collection Agent and Document Creation Agent. I integrated GHA and Confluence tools, establishing a robust service layer that enhanced the system's functionality and user experience.
Demonstrated strong leadership in graduate development by actively supporting multiple graduates across the domain, providing technical mentoring, and contributing to the AASP Domain's Graduate Framework. I led multiple knowledge-sharing sessions and ran technical hands-on sessions, helping to build technical capability within the team.
Showed commitment to community engagement by organising and leading the Clean Up Australia volunteering event for Melbourne graduates, fostering team spirit and environmental consciousness.
Maintained high responsiveness to technical issues, often addressing bugs and issues within the same day, while effectively managing multiple responsibilities and commitments.

Challenges and learnings:

I encountered significant technical challenges with the Agentic framework, which was initially in poor condition from an external vendor. I overcame this by conducting comprehensive cleanup of state management and RAG modules, along with code structure refactoring, demonstrating my problem-solving abilities and technical expertise.
I faced personal challenges with confidence in technical abilities and presentation anxiety, particularly evident during the crew demonstration of the agentic framework. Despite these challenges, I pushed through my comfort zone and successfully delivered the presentation, receiving positive feedback on my technical contributions.
Managing multiple commitments between squad work and graduate support required careful balance. I developed effective time management strategies while maintaining high-quality delivery standards, ensuring both immediate team needs and longer-term graduate development goals were met.
Working on complex technical implementations required making careful trade-offs and architectural decisions, particularly in the RAG feature development. I learned to balance technical requirements with practical constraints while maintaining code quality.


Development opportunities to take forward:

Focus on improving presentation and public speaking skills, particularly in demonstrating technical work to wider audiences including crew and leadership team. This includes working on managing presentation anxiety and building confidence in technical communications.
Enhance software architecture knowledge, specifically in frameworks like the C4 model, to better lead complex design discussions and improve system documentation.
Strengthen testing practises by incorporating more unit tests and automation/regression testing in development work, ensuring higher code quality and reliability.
Deepen knowledge of AWS services used in the XENA DHP solution by completing relevant AWS certifications and staying current with cloud technologies.
Work on breaking down work into smaller, more manageable pull requests to facilitate easier code reviews and improve team collaboration.
Improve team communication by being more proactive in initiating conversations and keeping team members informed about project progress.
Enhance personal organisation by staying on top of administrative tasks, including timely completion of training modules and regular email management.
Become a security champion for my team by doing training modules.
