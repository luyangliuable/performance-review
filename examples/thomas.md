## Reflect on your goals. What outcomes did you achieve and what impact did this have on customers? What did you learn along the way, and improve as a result?

Led the design and development of the 'XENA' GenAI application, from proof-of-concept to successful deployment on DHP, making our squad one of the first within the crew to deploy on the platform. XENA was successfully used by a business analyst to onboard a new Salesforce Marketing Intelligence usecase to the Data Exchange Platform which is now running in production, demonstrating the practical value and efficiency of leveraging generative AI to simplify the DEP self-service process.  I also presented the application in multiple live demos at a crew-wide level, to members of the LT and to other interested stakeholders within the Group.


## What is your overall assessment against KPI outcomes, considering feedback received?

Developed and implemented the Airflow platform and orchestration framework for the crew, particularly on enabling integration with AWS Glue, cross-account AWS access, supporting production workflow deployments, authored extensive onboarding guides and documentation and enhancing the SNS alerting solution. This platform now supports 23 production workloads across both CBIRBS and FRAUMD domains, significantly improving our operational efficiency. Additionally, I managed the monthly rotation of the CDL keys used by Airflow, ensuring compliance with group security requirements.

Decoupled the FRAUMD and CBIRBS Kafka pipelines, previously a single pipeline publishing 17 million customer model scores per domain on a daily basis to CEE for NBC decisioning. Provisioned a bespoke Kafka topic on MSK Eventhub and configured separate publishing apps as k8s cronjobs running on the API Hosting Platform EKS cluster, enhancing system's resilience and throughput.

Deployed a new Kafka producer application for a Salesforce Marketing Cloud data ingestion pipeline on the Data Exchange Platform, a cross-domain initiative. Managed end-to-end deployment, including engaging the EventHub team, presenting for endorsement, topic creation, SSL certificate provisioning, and k8s deployment configuration on the API Hosting EKS cluster. The pipeline ingests half-hourly microbatches of customer marketing data.

Completed the Secure by Design Champion training and certification, regularly attended the CDAO security champion fortnightly forum and authored RISE assessments for my squad.  I ensure our applications are secure by design and continuously enhance the team's security capabilities during code reviews and design conversations.

## What is your overall assessment of how you have demonstrated our values in your decisions and interactions?

Mentored multiple graduates and new team members, offering technical guidance and support during their onboarding and daily tasks, and assigning their tickets. Initiated code review sessions within my squad to maintain code quality standards and improve the peer review process for complex PRs.
